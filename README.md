- 👋 Hi, I’m @k0nduktr aka Contre-Jour (Photo Berlin)
- 👀 I’m an artist in photography, painting, but also programming (I am starting) using currently python and javascript.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning "konkrete Mathematik" and training myself. In addition I practise a lot of instinct photography
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI and Art (Alternative Intelligence, Neuronal Net with a purpose, Artificial Intelligence based on our content)
- My IT concept is keep things on the edge of art and nature. Nature can teach us so much we are just a glimpse in our current knowledge.

- 📫 How to reach me is by email: contre-jour@quantentunnel.de
